# Visualization-in-Python
We will be using various Python libraries to interactively visualize the data.

# Bokeh
- Bokeh is an interactive Python data visualization library which targets modern web browsers for presentation. Bokeh aims at providing high-performing interactivity with the concise construction of novel graphics over very large or even streaming datasets in a quick, easy way and elegant manner.

- Bokeh offers simple, flexible and powerful features and provides two interface levels:

1.Bokeh.models: A low-level interface which provides the application developers with most flexibility.
2.Bokeh.plotting: A higher-level interface to compose visual glyphs.

## Bokeh Dependencies
- Before beginning with Bokeh, we need to have NumPy installed on our machine.

## To install using pip open the terminal and run the following command:

- sudo pip install bokeh
